                    Brittanie is most passionate about politics and the sociological impacts of emerging technologies. She hopes to one day work within those fields of interest.

                    You can currently find Brittanie baking at her local bakery. Outside of work she loves to go on long runs, which might make her a psychopath. She’s training for her first marathon, regardless.
                </p>
                <p class="bio">In her spare time she also eats food, pets dogs, and writes bios about herself in the third person to sound more professional. She'd love to talk more with you. Drop her a line via the contact page!
